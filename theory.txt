-> create backend directory 

-> go inside the directory 

-> perform below command to create node project 

    #npm init -y 

-> now, next we need to install express (framework) and dotenv 

    #npm install express dotenv

-> take key from Gemini AI 

    create .env file and paste your key 

-> take Api key from strip for payment 

    paste key in .env file 

-> now, we have to install langchain library in backend project 

    #npm install @langchain/core

    #npm install @langchain/google-genai

-> now, we need to install cors 
--------------------------------------------
what is cors ? : 

    cross origin resource sharing 

    it is a security rule in browser 
    it controls which frontend can access your backend 

    e.g.  frontend running on : http://localhost:3000  (react)
          backend running on : http://localhost:5000  (node)

    so, browser says : both are coming from different origin (different ports)
        so, i will not allow and block for the security purpose. 

    at that time using of cors 
    it allows frontend to connect with backend 

    so, we have to install cors 

    #npm install cors 

--------------------------------------------
mongoose : it is a library which helps node.js to talk with mongo db database.

    in simple language we can say that mongoose is a bridge between node and mongodb.

    #npm install mongoose 

--------------------------------------------
install mongo db atlas community 

===========================================
FRONTEND ::: 

create project in react 

# npx create-react-app frontend 

    npx comes with npm, no global install needed
    frontend is your project folder name

    OR 

# npm create vite@latest frontend

    note : Vite is faster and lightweight than CRA

# cd project
# npm run dev
